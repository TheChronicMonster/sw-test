Service Worker test repository. This is a very simple demo to show basic service worker features in action.
Service Worker allows website responsiveness after internet connection has been lost. 
This works through asynchronous JSON calls and predefined promises.
This MDN resource, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker_API#Browser_compatibility is an excellent
place to begin learning about Service Workers.
